Introduction to JS:

1) Programming

We call the steps of execution of a code which is written is called Program.

Program in a running state is called Process.
Each process run on RAM [Random Access Memory] of your machine and memory is allocated to process until it runs. If process is closed, Memory will be cleared.

2) Keywords:

In a  programming language, few words are reserved by language for its won purpose. Cannot alter their meaning for any use case.

Few keywords in JS : let, var, const, If, else, return

3) Variables:
Variables are the storage buckets where a value is stored and has a name.
In 3 ways JS variables can be declared.
They are:
1) var
2) let
3) constgv

var variable_name = value;

var title = 'saikiran';
let age=30;
const x=100;

Note: One line of JS is an instruction the we give to computer. One complete instruction is called a statement. At the end of any statement in Js We can keep a semicolon. {Not mandatory in JS though but to keep it clean & readable}.

Naming rules for variable creation:
1) variable can contain small, capital alphabets, digits, underscore(_) and dollar ($).
2) We cannot have space or any other special Character (#,*,etc).
3) variable name cannot start a variable with digit in the start.
4) We cannot use keywords as variable names.
